# ACNH Stalk Market Analysis!

Welcome to what is likely the silliest analysis of the year. We are going to
analyze a sample of turnip data from Animal Crossing New Horizons. I assume
you've already run the setup chunk above (if not, that was a hint).

For those of you not familiar with the world's great anthropomorphic raccoon,
Tom Nook, and his islands in the sea, let's turn to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons):

> Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a 2020 social simulation game developed and
> published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch; it is the fifth main entry in
> the Animal Crossing series. In New Horizons, the player controls a character
> who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom
> Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they
> choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it
> into a community of anthropomorphic animals.


In a game genuinely meant for children, there is an activity called the Stalk
Market, where players can play a facsimile of the stock market. But I think [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Stalk_Market) explains this best:

> The Stalk Market refers to the system of buying and selling turnips in the
> Animal Crossing series. In the Stalk Market, players can buy and sell turnips
> in order to turn a profit, based on its fluctuating value as determined by the
> town store. The name is a pun on the real-life equivalent known as the stock
> market.

Sunday morning, you buy your turnips from Daisy Mae. Later in the week, you sell
them and hopefully make a profit. But when should we sell them to maximize our
ðŸ”” (the unit of money in ACNH). There are some strict rules:

- You can only buy turnips on Sunday.
- You cannot sell turnips on Sunday.
- Failure to sell your turnips by Saturday night is a 100% loss.
- Morning prices and afternoon prices differ, except on Sunday when there is
  only one price.



# Task 01

This data set has 1,419 samples in it. The `week` column assigns every sample
day to a specific week. Every week starts on a Sunday and ends on a
Saturday. There are no incomplete weeks in this data.

- **Question:** How many weeks of data do we have in this sample?
- **Answer:**

```{r}


```



# Task 02

Draw a boxplot of sale price for each day of the week, except Sunday.

- **Question:** Based on this plot, which days (on average) seem to be the best
  days to sell your turnips on and which days would you avoid?
- **Answer:**
- Helpful Hints:
    - YOU CANNOT SELL TURNIPS ON SUNDAY!!!

```{r}


```



# Task 03

- **Question:** What is the average sale price of Daisy Mae's turnips?
- **Answer:**

```{r}


```



# Task 04

Let's draw a new kind of plot, a trend line. You can do this by defining the x
aesthetic to the date and the y aesthetic to price. Use geom_line to, well, draw
the line. Use this plot to get some new ideas for the best day/time to sell
turnips.

- **Question:** Work as a team to develop a strategy to sell turnips which would
maximize your profits. Using your box plot, line plot, and any other plots or
information you make have created, tell me how you would maximize your turnip
sale price. Don't spend more than 15 minutes on this, but do spend some time
trying to maximize your ðŸ””. Be sure to explain what your group looked for and
your process for determining the best sales strategy.
- **Answer:**
- Helpful Hints:
    - Aesthetic is a reference to the `aes()` function which is short for
      aesthetic.
    - This may help you: https://r-graph-gallery.com/line-plot.html
    - YOU CANNOT SELL TURNIPS ON SUNDAY!!!

```{r}


```



# Task 05

Although this data is pretty good, we are missing some data.

- **Question:** How many rows of data are we missing and which days have the
  most missing data?
- **Answer:** 
- Helpful Hints:
    - is.na() is your friend.
    - https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html
    - For this question, include missing price data on Sunday as well.
